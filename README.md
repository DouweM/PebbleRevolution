Implemented by Douwe Maan.

Envisioned as a watchface by Jean-NoÃ«l Mattern (Jnm), who posted it in the ["Watch-face ideas" thread](http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/comment/3538/#Comment_3538) on the Pebble forums.

Based on the display of the [Freebox Revolution](http://www.free.fr/adsl/freebox-revolution.html), which was designed by Philippe Starck.

Optionally includes [QuickTap+](https://github.com/grep-awesome/QuickTapPlus) for weather, bluetooth, and battery info. To build with it, move/rename `qtp_js` to `src/js` and define `USE_QUICKTAP_PLUS` in `Revolution.c`.
